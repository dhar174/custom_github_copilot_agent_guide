# Setting up the GitHub MCP Server

Learn how to configure the GitHub Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

The GitHub MCP server is available to all GitHub users regardless of plan type. However, specific tools within the MCP server inherit the same access requirements as their corresponding GitHub features. If a feature requires a paid GitHub or Copilot license, the equivalent MCP tool will require the same subscription. For example, tools that interact with Copilot Coding Agent require a paid Copilot license.

For the latest information and updates, see the [GitHub MCP server repository](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server).

## About the GitHub MCP server

The GitHub MCP server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provided and maintained by GitHub. MCP allows you to integrate AI capabilities with other tools and services, enhancing your development experience by providing context-aware AI assistance.

For a full introduction to the GitHub MCP server and an overview of MCP, see [About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/en/copilot/concepts/about-mcp).

## Prerequisites

* A GitHub account.
* Visual Studio Code.
* If you are a member of an organization or enterprise with a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy must be enabled in order to use MCP with Copilot.

## Setting up the GitHub MCP server in Visual Studio Code

The GitHub MCP server in Visual Studio Code can be configured remotely or locally. The remote GitHub MCP server is hosted by GitHub and is the recommended option for most users. The local GitHub MCP server is hosted on your machine and is recommended for users who want to customize their setup or have specific security requirements.

The steps below describe remote configuration through the MCP marketplace in Visual Studio Code's extension panel. The MCP marketplace is powered by the GitHub MCP Registry. See [MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp).

For information on manually configuring the remote or local GitHub MCP server, see the [GitHub MCP server documentation](https://github.com/mcp/io.github.github/github-mcp-server?ref_product=copilot\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text).

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the extensions panel by clicking the extensions icon in the sidebar or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> (Windows/Linux) / <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> (Mac).
2. In the extensions search bar, click the filter icon and select **MCP Server** from the dropdown.
3. If it is your first time using the MCP Servers Marketplace, follow the prompts on screen to enable the Marketplace.
4. In the search bar, type `github` and select the GitHub MCP server from the search results.
5. On the GitHub MCP server configuration page, click **Install**.
6. To check that the GitHub MCP server is configured correctly, open the command palette by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Windows/Linux) / <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (Mac).
7. Type and select **MCP: List Servers**. You should see `github` listed as a configured server.

For a full introduction to the GitHub MCP server and an overview of MCP, see [About Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/en/copilot/concepts/about-mcp).

## Prerequisites

* **Access to Copilot**. See [What is GitHub Copilot?](/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot#getting-access-to-copilot).
* **Visual Studio version 17.14 or later**. For more information on installing Visual Studio, see the [Visual Studio downloads page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
* **Sign in to GitHub from Visual Studio**.
* If you are a member of an organization or enterprise with a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy must be enabled in order to use MCP with Copilot.

## Setting up the GitHub MCP server in Visual Studio

The instructions below guide you through setting up the GitHub MCP server in Visual Studio. Other MCP-compatible editors may have similar steps, but the exact process may vary.

The remote GitHub MCP server uses one-click OAuth authentication by default, but you can also manually configure it to use a personal access token (PAT) for authentication. If you use OAuth, the MCP server can only access the scopes you approve during sign-in. In organization-owned contexts, access may also be limited by admin policies that control which scopes and apps are permitted. If you use a PAT, the MCP server will have access to the scopes granted by the PAT, which is also subject to any PAT restrictions configured by the organization.

> \[!NOTE]
> If you are an Enterprise Managed User, then PAT is disabled by default, unless enabled by an enterprise administrator. If PAT is disabled, you won't be able to use PAT authentication. If you have OAuth access policy restrictions, you will need the OAuth App for each client (MCP host application) to be enabled (except Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio).

For information on setting up the GitHub MCP server locally, see the [GitHub MCP server documentation](https://github.com/mcp/io.github.github/github-mcp-server?ref_product=copilot\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text).

### Remote MCP server configuration with OAuth

You do not need to create a PAT or install any additional software to use the remote GitHub MCP server with OAuth. You can set it up directly in Visual Studio.

1. In the Visual Studio menu bar, click **View**, then click **GitHub Copilot Chat**.

2. At the bottom of the chat panel, select **Agent** from the mode dropdown.

3. In the Copilot Chat window, click the tools icon, then click the plus icon in the tool picker window.

4. In the "Configure MCP server" pop-up window, fill out the fields.
   1. For "Server ID", type `github`.
   2. For "Type", select "HTTP/SSE" from the dropdown.
   3. For "URL", type `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`.

5. Click **Save**. The configuration in the `mcp.json` file should look like this:

   ```json copy
       {
         "servers": {
           "github": {
             "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/"
           }
         }
       }
   ```

6. In the `mcp.json` file, click **Auth** from the CodeLens above the server to authenticate to the server. A pop-up will come up allowing you to authenticate with your GitHub account.

### Remote MCP server configuration with PAT

To configure the remote GitHub MCP server with a PAT, ensure you have created a PAT with the necessary scopes for the access you want to grant to the MCP server. For more information, see [Managing your personal access tokens](/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

1. In the Visual Studio menu bar, click **View**, then click **GitHub Copilot Chat**.
2. At the bottom of the chat panel, select **Agent** from the mode dropdown.
3. In the Copilot Chat window, click the tools icon, then click the plus icon in the tool picker window.
4. In the "Configure MCP server" pop-up window, fill out the fields.
   1. For "Server ID", type `github`.
   2. For "Type", select "HTTP/SSE" from the dropdown.
   3. For "URL", type `https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/`.
   4. Add a new header under "Headers", called "Authorization" and set to the value `Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_PAT`, replacing "YOUR\_GITHUB\_PAT" with your PAT.
5. Click **Save**. The configuration in the `mcp.json` file should look like this:

   ```json copy
     {
       "servers": {
           "github": {
               "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
               "requestInit": {
                   "headers": {
                       "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_GITHUB_PAT"
                   }
               }
           }
       }
     }
   ```

* **Access to Copilot**. See [What is GitHub Copilot?](/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot#getting-access-to-copilot).
* **Compatible version of Eclipse**. To use the GitHub Copilot extension, you must have Eclipse version 2024-09 or above. See the [Eclipse download page](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).
* If you are a member of an organization or enterprise with a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise plan, the "MCP servers in Copilot" policy must be enabled in order to use MCP with Copilot.
* **Latest version of the GitHub Copilot extension**. Download this from the [Eclipse Marketplace](https://aka.ms/copiloteclipse?ref_product=copilot\&ref_type=engagement\&ref_style=text). For more information, see [Installing the GitHub Copilot extension in your environment](/en/copilot/managing-copilot/configure-personal-settings/installing-the-github-copilot-extension-in-your-environment?tool=eclipse).
* **Sign in to GitHub from Eclipse**.

## Setting up the GitHub MCP server in Eclipse

The instructions below guide you through setting up the GitHub MCP server in Eclipse. Other MCP-compatible editors may have similar steps, but the exact process may vary.

The remote GitHub MCP server uses one-click OAuth authentication by default, but you can also manually configure it to use a personal access token (PAT) for authentication. If you use OAuth, the MCP server can only access the scopes you approve during sign-in. In organization-owned contexts, access may also be limited by admin policies that control which scopes and apps are permitted. If you use a PAT, the MCP server will have access to the scopes granted by the PAT, which is also subject to any PAT restrictions configured by the organization.

> \[!NOTE]
> If you are an Enterprise Managed User, then PAT is disabled by default, unless enabled by an enterprise administrator. If PAT is disabled, you won't be able to use PAT authentication. If you have OAuth access policy restrictions, you will need the OAuth App for each client (MCP host application) to be enabled (except Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio).

For information on setting up the GitHub MCP server locally, see the [GitHub MCP server repository](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server#usage-in-other-mcp-hosts-1).

### Remote MCP server configuration with OAuth

You do not need to create a PAT or install any additional software to use the remote GitHub MCP server with OAuth. You can set it up directly in Eclipse.
